Mercury was born Farrokh Bulsara in Stone Town in the British protectorate of Zanzibar (present day Tanzania) on 5 September 1946.[6][7] His parents, Bomi (1908–2003) and Jer (1922–2016) Bulsara,[a][8] were Parsis from the Gujarat region of the then-province of the Bombay Presidency in British India.[b][6]
They had moved to Zanzibar so that Bomi could continue his job as a cashier at the British Colonial Office. As Parsis, the Bulsara family practised the Zoroastrian religion.[9] Mercury had a younger sister, Kashmira Bulsara, who took her husband's surname after marrying Roger Cooke.[10] He was born with four supernumerary incisors, to which he attributed his enhanced vocal range.[11][12] As Zanzibar was a British protectorate until 1963, Mercury was born a British citizen. He remained so throughout his life.[13]
Mercury spent most of his childhood in India where he began taking piano lessons at the age of seven while living with relatives.[14] In 1954, at the age of eight, Mercury was sent to study at St. Peter's School, a British-style boarding school for boys, in Panchgani near Bombay.[13] At the age of 12, he formed a school band, the Hectics, and covered rock and roll artists such as Cliff Richard and Little Richard.[15][16] One of Mercury's former bandmates from the Hectics has said "the only music he listened to, and played, was Western pop music."[17] A friend from the time recalls that he had "an uncanny ability to listen to the radio and replay what he heard on piano".[18] It was also at St. Peter's where he began to call himself "Freddie". He also attended St. Mary's School, Mumbai.[19] In February 1963 he moved back to Zanzibar where he joined his parents at their flat.[20]
In 1964, Mercury and his family fled from Zanzibar to escape the violence of the revolution for independence,[21] in which thousands of ethnic Arabs and Indians were killed.[22] They moved into a small house at 22 Gladstone Avenue, Feltham, Middlesex, England. After first studying art at Isleworth Polytechnic in West London, Mercury studied graphic art and design at Ealing Art College, graduating with a diploma in 1969.[2] He later used these skills to design heraldic arms for his band Queen.[23]
Following graduation, Mercury joined a series of bands and sold second-hand clothes in Kensington Market in London with girlfriend Mary Austin. He also held a job as a baggage handler at Heathrow Airport.[24] Friends from the time remember him as a quiet and shy young man with a great interest in music.[25]
In 1969 he joined the Liverpool-based band Ibex, later renamed Wreckage. He lived briefly in a flat above a Liverpool pub, The Dovedale Towers.[26][27] When this band failed to take off, he joined another called Sour Milk Sea, but by early 1970 this group had broken up as well.[28]
